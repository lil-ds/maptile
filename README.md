# maptile
My [map tile web page](https://lil-ds.github.io/maptile/) is a project centered around learning how to use Mapbox as well as working with map tiles in HTML. For all of my tile maps, I decided to focus on the Seattle-Bellevue area because I am currently living there because of University. All the tile maps have zoom levels 3-14 available. I wanted to achieve a level of detail, but still maintain a larger viewing of the general area. The projections used for all maps is the Mercator projection. 

In a screenshot below of tile map number one, I decided to employ a newer color scheme than that of the basic monochrome one offered by Mapbox. I picked purple because I wanted to design a map that would employ my school colors. The font family chosen for this basemap is Ubuntu, which I chose because of my love for the rounded edges of the letters. I also included icons for areas of interest, as well as for airports.

For tile map two, I created a dot distibution map to show all the hospitals in Seattle. Each dot represents one public hospital recorded for the City of Seattle. The dataset was last updated in 2022, making it very recent. I decided to attach the name of the hospital to each point since the area was so concentrated and since there were only around nineteen hospitals in the entire Seattle area. I decided to use a streetmap as a basemap because it's useful to see which hospitals are near major roads/how roads is designed around it.

The third tile map is a combination of the basemap I created from my school colors, and the dot distribution map of all hospitals in Seattle. This exercise was helpful for me to learn how to mesh together different styles on Mapbox.

The final tile map was a fun, creative exercise. Here, I created my own basemap off of a theme of something special: the cherry blossoms at the University of Washington. As an out of state student, seeing the cherry blossoms for the first time was something extremely magical. Especially at the Quad in spring, it felt like I was in a different world. I wanted to replicate the colors there into this map to forever memoralize my time here. The gold is taken from the official UW hex code, the green represents the grassy fields at the Quad, and the pink is the cherry blossoms that bloomed so beautifully. I also decided to add in a little nod to the UW mascot, the husky dog, with little pawprints that designated points of interest on the map.
